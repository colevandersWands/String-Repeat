# [String Reverser](https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-repeat/train/javascript)

Simple still, I'm only doing 8's. It repeats a string over and over.

String_Repeat: Function
* Args: 2
  1. Number: used to determine how many duplicates to make
  2. String: the thing that's duplicated
* Return: String
  * The argument string concatinated to itself "String" many times
* Behavior: The function takes in a number and a string, it copies the string x nubmer of times where x is the first argument to the function.  It will return those copies stuck together in a single string

## Solution Process

Using plain sentences and pseudocode, explain the process you followed from reading the Codewar prompt to coding your final solution.  Describe what you were thinking at every step, how that step moved you forward (or backwards, note that too!), and provide a little pseudocode to illustrate each step.

This may feel tedious but we promise you it will pay off in the long run.  By paying attention to you thinking process you will start to notice what strategies work for you, which strategies you use too often, and where you struggle.  Even more importantly, writing out your process will help you generalize your problem solving skills - taking them from the world of coding small challenges to the world of application development.

If you find yourself getting stuck or having trouble understanding just what you're supposed to do, try taking a few simple examples inputs and solving them by hand.  This will make the problem more tangible and less abstract.  Be sure to include these manual solutions in your process description!

Stick with it!  It's best to learn how to analyze your thinking while the problems are simpler.  You don't want to be trying to understand a full project __and__ your problem solving style a the same time.

## Solution Explanation

Explain your solution in detail, however works for you.  Perhaps by using a specific input to illustrate, by listing the strategies you used, or by including a diagram [directly from Sketchboard.io](https://sketchboard.io/blog/2014/03/06/github-sketchboard.html).

## Constraints

List and explain the constraints you placed on your solution.

___

## Language Features

List the language features used in your solution.

The focus of these exercises are to strengthen you problem solving skills, not to learn the newest ES6 tricks. When you have the choice between to different language features it is better to choose the option that is easiest to read, most common, or most consistent with the rest of your solution.  

Keeping track of the language features you use will enable you separate the problem solving strategy from the implementation.  Being aware of this difference will be an asset later on when you're faced with larger applications and popular frameworks.
